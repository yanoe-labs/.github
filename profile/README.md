**YANOE** — **Y**et **A**nother **N**on-**O**fficial **E**thereum Labs.

Born out of the gaps between "official" tooling and what edgy researchers/developers actually need, YANOE is a self-custody organization focused on the Ethereum and EVM-compatible ecosystem.

We aim to build sharp, experimental, and practical tools for auditors, security researchers, and advanced protocol engineers.
